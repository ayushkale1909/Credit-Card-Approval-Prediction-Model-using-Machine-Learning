# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction-Model-using-Machine-Learning
## 
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Manually analyzing these applications is
error-prone, and time-consuming. We can automate the task using machine learning. We can do so by
developing an “accept or reject” category of customers. With a large dataset and all of the customer’s
demographics available, we can build a Machine Learning model to perform such segmentation. The
main goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model for credit card approval prediction.

## 

The data-set used for this project is publicly available at University of California machine learning
repository and Kaggle. This data set consists of the records of consumers from the bank.
